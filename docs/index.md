## Quick Start

```bash
npm install tapsdk-pc
```

```typescript
import { TapSdk, EventId, SystemState } from 'tapsdk-pc';

// Check if restart is needed (call before init)
if (TapSdk.restartAppIfNecessary('your_client_id')) {
  process.exit(0);
}

// Initialize the SDK
const sdk = new TapSdk('your_public_key');

// Check game ownership
if (!sdk.isGameOwned()) {
  console.log('User does not own this game');
  process.exit(1);
}

// Listen for events (automatically polled in background)
sdk.on('event', (event) => {
  // Handle events...
});
